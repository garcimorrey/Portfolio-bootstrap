                                <p>Born in Cannes (France) in 1994. I have studied Business Hospitallity Management at Vatel Business School in Nimes (France) during 2years (2012-2014). Then I have started to study communication at Iscom Advertising School in Paris(France) during another 2years (2016-2018). I dropped out of both school before the end of my bachelor for the reasons that I am creative and I wanted to start my own project.
                                        <br> That is why in 2014 after leaving my Hospitality School, I started my first company at 20 years old. A fashion app, which allowed the users to share/comment the fashion trends and their clothes publications by posting Polls instead regular publications. The final goal was to get important fashion datas about future fashion trends, and also to create a payment platform in the future via the users community created in the app.
                                        I created the company, first in London (2014-2016) and then moved back to France for my studies when I saw that I did not do everything well at my young age. However this experience, even it was a fail has allowed me to improve myself. <br>
                                        ..During the next two years I have spent lot of times in my comminucation school, which has allowed me to improve my skills to understand people's behaviour better. In the same time I have learned PAO skills. That allowed me to make the design of my app by myself. I created some connections with engineers and I have picked one up to help me to code my app. I had no real knowledge at this time about coding. That is why I had some problems to understand some of his issuess with the app. That experience has allowed mo to understand the fact that it order to manage that kind of project, you need to know exactly what you are talking about. <br>
                                        ..In 2018 I decided to get a new challenge by moving back to my mother's country: The United States. And more precisely in Los Angeles, where I decided to start the UCLA coding bootcamp because I wanted to get approbation and improve my skills to start my future business, but this time creating everything by myself.
                                    <br> I found out that I was really passionated about coding when I arrived in L.A., starting on Freecodecamp. I think if I had to describe myself, I would say that I am creative, dynamic, perspicacious and MAINLY, REALLY DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE MY GOALS.
                                        <br>I plan to start another company, but this time in the US in the betting market with a new website that I am working on.
